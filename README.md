- 👋 Hi, I’m @wakehood
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things but especially software. I really like ways to write mobile software for multiple platforms.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Visual Studio on a Mac. So far it is very similar to Visual Studio on a PC.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun things.
